Welcome. I'm Joseph, your instructor. Congratulations on taking your next
step toward becoming a data scientist. Python is a top language for data science. Now that you know how
to program with Python, you're going to use
Python to analyze data. In this course, you will learn to
use the most important libraries for analyzing data in Python,
including NumPy, Pandas, and Klearn. These Python libraries are integral
to becoming a data scientist and used in industries such as healthcare,
finance, insurance, all things Internet, and many others. In addition to analyzing data, you'll
learn how to build data pipelines and build your own machine learning model for
making predictions on real world data set. In module one, you'll learn how to
understand the data set characteristics, get an overview of Python packages for
analyzing data, and learn how to import data and
start analyzing it. In module two, I will teach you
data wrangling preprocessing, dealing with missing values, followed by
data formatting and data normalization. In module three, you'll be introduced to
exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics GroupBy, correlation,
and other important statistics. In module four, you will learn
linear regression, model evaluation, polynomial regression, and pipelines
measures for In-sample evaluation, prediction and decision making. In module five, you will discover model
evaluation and refinement overfitting, underfitting, model selection,
ridge regression, and grid search. Finally, you will practice your newly
acquired skills with a Hands-On project using a real world data set. The only prerequisites for this course
are programming with Python and high school math. Good luck and have fun.
