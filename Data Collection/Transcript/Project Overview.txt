Welcome to the project overview video. For this capstone project, you will assume
the role of an Associate Data Analyst at a technology consulting organization. Your primary task is to analyze the data
and obtain valuable insights into current and future technological trends using the latest
Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset. These insights will play a key role in guiding
strategic business decisions. In this project, you will analyze data to answer
key questions about the use of technology. You will analyze trends in programming languages,
databases, platforms, and frameworks, focusing on those technologies professionals currently
use and those they aim to learn in the future. Through careful analysis, you will extract
insights that highlight emerging patterns and shifts in the tech landscape. These findings will then be presented to various
stakeholders in your organization for informed decision making. Throughout this project, you will use industry
standard tools and software. This project aims to extract, transform,
analyze data from a relational database using SQL and Python. You will utilize Python's data analysis libraries
such as Pandas and NumPy to explore the data. The extracted data will be processed and visualized
using Jupyter Notebook. You will create a dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics
or Google Looker Studio. Finally, you will present the insights in a comprehensive
PowerPoint presentation. The dataset for Stack Overflow Developer Survey includes
responses from developers worldwide, detailing the technologies they currently work with
and those they wish to work with in the future. You'll be provided with a filtered and pre-processed
version of this data to ensure consistency in your analysis. You will begin the project by collecting data using
API access and web scraping techniques. After gathering the data, you will engage in various
data wrangling tasks, including handling duplicates, identifying and addressing
missing values, and normalizing the data. After ensuring data is accurate and ready for
analysis, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA. At this stage, you will examine the distribution of
responses and identify patterns in developer preferences and technology trends. This involves plotting distribution curves and
histograms, detecting outliers that may skew your analysis, and exploring correlations
between various features in the dataset. Once you have a solid grasp of the data,
you will engage in data visualization, creating visualizations that effectively display trends and relationships. You will create various types of visualization,
such as histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts to make your findings visually
engaging and easy to interpret. Following the visual analysis, you will build
interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio. The dashboards are divided into three distinct parts,
each focusing on different aspects of technology usage and trends. These parts include Current Technology Usage Dashboard,
Future Technology Trends Dashboard, Demographics Dashboard. Once your dashboards are complete,
you will export them as PDF files and upload them. This step ensures you have a professional link
to share with peers and evaluators while also maintaining a record of your project for your portfolio. Through these processes, you will develop your
analytical skills and create impactful visualizations that effectively communicate
key insights into technology usage and trends. Throughout this course, you will be assessed
on your data analysis skills, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory
data analysis, and data visualization. The final project will undergo a peer-graded
assessment to evaluate whether you have included the correct dashboards and visualizations,
accurately represented metrics, and used appropriate chart types. Clear titles, labels, and the correct use of
color coding are essential for achieving high scores. This capstone project will test your data
analysis skills and ability to communicate data findings effectively. The project will conclude with a final PowerPoint
presentation, where you will deliver a well-structured report outlining the insights drawn from your analysis. This presentation will emphasize best practices
in visual communication and data storytelling, ensuring your findings make a lasting impact on
strategic decision-making. By the end of this project, you will gain hands-on
experience in data wrangling, visualization, and dashboard creation using industry-standard tools. These skills are critical for distinguishing
yourself as a data analyst in the competitive tech landscape. We hope you share our excitement as we begin this journey. Good luck, and let's start uncovering the insights
hidden within the technology landscape.
